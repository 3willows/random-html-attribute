### [Random MDN page](https://random-mdn-page-b6lncbu8p-jasper-wongs-projects.vercel.app/)

Fork of this project by Andrew Healey: [A Tiny Project, From Inception to Deployment](https://healeycodes.com/tiny-project-to-completion)

#### Changes 

- hosted on Vercel not Glitch
- use the ```ejs``` view engine
-  ```getNewPages.js``` now tracks [this page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes) rather than the [original page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Index) (no longer maintained by MDN).


#### Improvement ideas (from Andrew's original project)

- Move the scraping to a cron job
- Address the ~1/900 chance of getting the same page twice
  - Perhaps a client-side re-request?
