### [Random MDN page](https://random-mdn-page-b6lncbu8p-jasper-wongs-projects.vercel.app/)

Fork of this project by Andrew Healey: [A Tiny Project, From Inception to Deployment](https://healeycodes.com/tiny-project-to-completion)

#### Improvement ideas

- Update ```getNewPages.js``` in light of the fact that the [index page](with this old url https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Index) is no longer maintained by MDN.

(From Andrew's original project)
- Move the scraping to a cron job
- Address the ~1/900 chance of getting the same page twice
  - Perhaps a client-side re-request?
